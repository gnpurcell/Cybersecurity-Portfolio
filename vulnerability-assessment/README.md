# Vulnerability Assessment & Remediation Plan

## **Overview**
Performed a vulnerability assessment on a Linux-based database server hosting customer, campaign, and analytics data, using NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 as the risk analysis guide.

## **Objective**
Evaluate threats to the database server, score risks based on likelihood and impact, and propose remediation strategies to strengthen security posture.

## **System Description**
- Linux OS with MySQL database  
- 128 GB memory, IPv4 networking  
- Stores customer + marketing analytics data  
- Uses SSL/TLS for encrypted connections

## **Scope**
- Focused on **access controls** and related security measures  
- Assessment window: June – August (3 months)  
- Risk assessment aligned to **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**

## **Threats & Risks (Examples)**
- **Competitor** performing man-in-the-middle attacks (Risk score: 6)  
- **Operating system** exploited to install malicious software and access sensitive data (Risk score: 9)  
- **External hacker** conducting a DoS attack to disrupt services (Risk score: 9)

## **Impact**
- Loss of confidentiality of customer and campaign data  
- Service disruption impacting marketing operations  
- Potential reputational and financial damage

## **Recommendations**
- Implement the **AAA framework** (authentication, authorization, accounting) for all database access.  
- Deploy a **firewall** to filter and monitor inbound/outbound traffic.  
- Use **VPNs** for remote employees accessing the network.  
- Add **endpoint protection** on systems that access or manage the database.

## **Key Skills Demonstrated**
- Structured vulnerability assessment  
- Risk scoring and documentation  
- Application of NIST SP 800-30  
- Development of practical remediation strategies
