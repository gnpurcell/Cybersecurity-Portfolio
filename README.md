# Gabriella's Cybersecurity Portfolio  
A collection of hands-on defensive security projects demonstrating my skills in SOC analysis, threat hunting, digital forensics, Linux hardening, and governance.  

I specialize in **blue-team, detection engineering, and incident response**, and I build projects that show how I think — not just what I can memorize.  
This portfolio highlights practical, real-world scenarios and the workflows I would use in a SOC environment.

## About Me
I’m a security-minded analyst focused on SOC, Blue Team, and IR roles.  
I love digging through logs, breaking down attacks, automating annoying tasks, and building strong defensive controls.

**Currently working on:**  
- CySA+  
- Splunk Core User  
- MITRE ATT&CK Defender  
- Building out a home SOC lab  
- Python automation

**Tools I use:**  
- Splunk  
- Wireshark  
- TCPDump  
- Linux CLI  
- SQL  
- Python  
- NIST Frameworks  
- MITRE ATT&CK
