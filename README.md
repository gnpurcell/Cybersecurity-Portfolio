# Cybersecurity-Portfolio
Hi! I’m Gabriella, a security-minded analyst building hands-on projects that show how I investigate, analyze, and protect systems in real-world scenarios. My portfolio focuses on blue-team, SOC analysis, incident response, and Python automation, the actual skills you need on the job, not just textbook theory.
